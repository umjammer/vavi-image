## Installation

 * maven repo.
```xml
    <repository>
      <id>github</id>
      <url>https://maven.pkg.github.com/umjammer/*</url>
    </repository>

    <dependency>
      <groupId>vavi</groupId>
      <artifactId>vavi-image</artifactId>
      <version>1.0.9</version>
    </dependency>
```
 * if you want to use ffmpeg resizing
   * [pom.xml](https://github.com/umjammer/vavi-image/wiki/Install-ffmpeg-native-library)
   * exec jvm w/ `java.library.path` system property e.g `-Djava.library.path=/target/test-classes`

## TODO

 * test `OctTreeQuantizer` (only 256 colors?)  
 * complete `ImageMagikQuantizer`
 * Lanczos3 filter using AWT API
 * `BufferedImageOp` ???
 * https://github.com/iariro/N88BasicImage
 * ffmpeg resize 4byte 32bit operation is wrong

## Tech Know

 * Mac Open JDK's JNI library extension is `.dylib`
 * `libsescale` has MMX bug, this causes segmentation fault when resizing image.
